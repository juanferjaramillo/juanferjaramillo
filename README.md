I consider myself fortunate to have a career that aligns with my personal interests. As an electronics engineer, I derive immense satisfaction from incorporating various technologies into each project I undertake.

Motivated by my insatiable curiosity and a strong dedication to ongoing growth, I embraced the challenge of becoming a full stack JavaScript developer. To accomplish this, I enrolled in the bootcamp and labs program offered by @soyhenry.

This rigorous and demanding program equipped me with the technical skills necessary to construct web applications from both the front and back ends. I gained proficiency in JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, and Sequelize.js, enabling me to create efficient and dynamic web-based solutions. Additionally, my involvement as a Teaching Assistant further enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively within a team setting, fostering the development of my soft skills.

Presently, I take pride in possessing the knowledge and skills required to develop, manage, and enhance full stack web applications with speed and efficacy. My current aspiration revolves around securing a developer position with an international organization that can leverage my technical capabilities, proficiency in English, strong interpersonal skills, and strong commitment to continuous learning.

Ultimately, my affinity for technology has always been my greatest passion and area of expertise. I embrace the opportunity to participate in tech projects and contribute to their advancement.
